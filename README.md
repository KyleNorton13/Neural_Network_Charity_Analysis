# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to design a nueral network in order to create a binary classification model that is able to predict if an organization backed by Alphabet Soup will be successful. In order to do this the data needed to be preprocessed a considerable amount which was accomplished in deliverable 1. After the preprocessing we evaluated our our models accuracy with two hidden layers. For deliverable 2 we needed to make adjustments in order to increase the optimization and accuracy of the model.
